# Welcome to the Smart Card Laboratory!

## Directory Structure

* Lab_reports folder contains the lab reports. The presentation slides of Midterm and Final topics are in the parent directory

## Part A work
* Midterm_DPA folder contains the first order DPA script.
* "Midterm_DPA/Compression Logs" folder consists of the script and logs of different compression techniques used for first order DPA.
* "SmartOS/aes/Hardened AES Implementation" folder contain all the different countermeasure techniques implemented as based on the file. These files are to be used separately in place of inv_aes.c in "SmartOS/aes" folder.

## Part B work
* SmartOS folder contain the clone of smartcard.
* Second Order DPA folder contains the implemented DPA attack on countermeasures.
