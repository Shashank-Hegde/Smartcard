* With D Shunt Resistor, wrong key values were observed (with and without compression) due to the zero resistance across its ends.
* With higher compression windows, correlation increases upto a certain limit, with better processing speed.
* Minimum Traces to break the key was 1000 traces with 75000 samples.
* Higher Samples and traces did not proportionate with higher correlation value

__Phase 2__
* Program memory with shuffling: 7764 bytes 
* Data memory with shuffling: 1983 bytes
