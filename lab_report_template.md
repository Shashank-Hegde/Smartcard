## __Second part: Hardened AES implementation__ ##

* **Date:** *19/12/2022 - 23/12/2022*
* **Tasks:**          
  * Concept understanding of how to implement the countermeasures on the AES implemented by Team B

* **Date:** *09/1/2023 - 13/1/2023*
* **Tasks:**          
  * Implementation of only masking algorithm

* **Date:** *16/1/2023 - 25/1/2023*
* **Tasks:**          
  * Implementation of shuffling, dummy operations and no operation
  * Tried out srand(), rand() for random number generation. We also tried a counter for random number generation, but results from srand() were better.
  * Tried different combinations of countermeasures
  * Observed the AES excution timmings for pure AES and also for AES with countermeasures 
  * Completed the ppt and report
